# InstaCycle
App as a part of fll project

It is an app as a part of FLL competition 2015. The theme is recycling.

It has 5 tabs at the bottom based on the customer request.

It has scanning functionality that scans products and detect if they have recyclable containers.

All other tabs are just demos, just images.
